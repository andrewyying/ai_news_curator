You are summarizing a cluster of tech/AI news articles that all talk about the same underlying event or topic.

You are given a JSON list "articles", each with "title", "content", "source", "impact_score", and "impact_reason".

Produce a single JSON object with:
{
  "title": "A short, informative title (max 80 characters)",
  "summary": "A concise but complete summary (3-6 sentences) that captures what happened, why it matters, and key numbers/dates if present. Do not speculate.",
  "responsible_ai_notes": "If there are any concerns (e.g., hype, safety, misinformation, bias, privacy), briefly note them; otherwise use an empty string."
}

Be factual and cautious. If something is unclear, explicitly say so.
